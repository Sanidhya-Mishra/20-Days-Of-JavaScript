Day 13: Javascript Quiz Engine

Description: 

Everybody loves a good quiz! Luckily, building a small quiz with JavaScript is quite easy â€“ and they can be super helpful.

If you want to make money freelancing, you can build a portfolio website to showcase your projects. Use a quiz on the site to help potential clients find the right services for their problems, for example.

Or, if you blog about coding (go you!), you can help your readers find the right resources and articles based on what they want to learn.

Simply create a small quiz to determine what their goals are and direct them to tutorials and blog posts to help them get started.
