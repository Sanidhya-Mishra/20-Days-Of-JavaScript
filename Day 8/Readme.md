DAY 8: PONG GAME

Description:
Pong was one of my favorite video games back in the day!

Did you know that it was the very first commercially successful video game ever?

Building the game in JavaScript takes some work, but the end results can is tons of fun to play.

Again, start by thinking about the rules of the game and map out the different events your code needs to cover.

As you build the game, you will probably come up with a few ideas on how to make it more fun.

Also, you may want to create different difficulty levels for your game. For example:

The ball could move faster after a given number of rounds
To make things trickier for the player, allow for the computer to move the paddle more quickly
Pong is a rather complex project if you are entirely new to JavaScript. I think the most difficult part of this project idea is to make sure the computer doesnâ€™t always win.

Hence, make sure you have a couple of easier projects under your belt before tackling this one.
