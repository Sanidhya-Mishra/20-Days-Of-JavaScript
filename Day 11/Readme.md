Day 11: Javascript microcode editor

Description: 

Wouldnâ€™t it be cool to code your own mini-code editor in JavaScript? I think this is a cool project idea

This is a micro code editor constructed with the help of javascript.

It is mainly supported by javascript codes.



Example :

This is a 'Hello World' example.



function greetings(name){

  name = name || "stranger";

  return "Hello, " + name + "!";

}

window.onLoad = alert(greetings());
