Day 16: Javascript Maze Game
Description: 

I was a huge fan of drawing my own maze games when I was a kid in the early â€™90s. Therefore, learning how to code my own maze with JavaScript was so much fun.

As for the difficulty of this JavaScript project, it is somewhat more demanding.

Thus, if you are just getting started, make sure you feel comfortable enough with the language before you start building this game.
