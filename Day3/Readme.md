Rock Paper Scissors Project
- In this project I have made a website in which the user can play rock paper scissors with the computer.
- The player can choose a move between rock, paper and scissors, and the computer will also pick a random move.
- According to the rules of rock paper and scissors, the player either wins or loses the round, which is also displayed in the results section.

Test Cases:
- Press "Rock" button 3 times
- Press "Paper" button 3 times
- Press "Scissors" button 3 times
