DAY 14 : Javascript Vertical Timeline

Description: 
A custom-made JavaScript timeline can be a great feature for building websites for freelance clients, for instance.

Businesses and start-ups often want to display their most significant milestones on their website.

Also, you can use the code from your JS timeline for other similar applications.

For example, letâ€™s say you want to break down important steps into bite-sized portions for your website visitors.

With a JavaScript timeline, you can display small bits of a specific story or piece of content to your readers without overwhelming them with too much information at once.
